      <h3>You make a difference</h3>
      <p>
        There are so many abandoned and unwanted cats and kittens in our Auckland communities. Our aim is to de-sex, vaccinate, and microchip every stray cat in the hope that one day each of them will have a loving home.

        We are committed to educating the community, particularly New Zealand youth. Education of our new generation is paramount, teaching our young people to embrace their responsibility to care for their cats. Our stance is that we do not have a "cat problem"; we have a "people problem".

        We offer a sanctuary to unwanted stray cats in a protected environment where all their needs are met in an indoor/outdoor environment.
